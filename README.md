## Inspiration 
When I first moved to Colorado from the east coast, I was unfamilier with the trees. I was working an outdoor guide and quickly had to get up to speed so I could share information to my clients about the beutifuls trees found in Colorado. Reflecting on this expereince inspired me to make this project for other who would like to learn more about trees in Colorado.
